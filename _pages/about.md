I’m a Research Assistant in the Department of Impact Evaluation (DIME) at The World Bank and at the Faculty of Economics at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá. 

I received my BA and MCs degrees in economics from Universidad de los Andes in 2021 and 2023 respectively. I'm interested in developing economics, spatial economics, and determinants of crime. My masters' thesis studies the effect of transport subsidies in a developing context to assess changes in welfare, measured as consumer surplus, generated by the policy.  

I have been Teacher Assistant for introductory econometrics and the ungraduated and graduate level, introductory and intermediate macroeconomics at the undergraduate level for the Faculty of Economics at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá.
